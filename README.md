## About The App/ How to use:

This is a simple interactive app that will let you access NASA's photograph of the day! Select the date you would like from the date input and click the 'fire!' button, 
it will show you the photopgraph with the explanation.


## How It's Made:

It was created using HTML, CSS, JS and Font Awesome. One of my first application built using APIs. I like the fact that these images are coming from NASA daily! 

## Tech Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript



## Lessons Learned:

I learned the very basics of how WebAPI works, such as how to send requests and implement the response into my website.
